# Pig-Game
A fun interactive 2-player dice game developed with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

How to play: <br />
Role the dice until your score adds up to 20. When you score reaches 20, you win! But try not to role a 1 because if you do, your score will be reset back to 0. <br />
<br />
If you role a 1, then it is the other players turn to try to get to 20. If you start to feel like you are getting unlucky, then hold your score and let the other player roll the dice instead. Maybe they will role a 1 and the luck is back in favour! <br />
<br />
It is all within the luck of the die. :<br />
GOOD LUCK!
